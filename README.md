## Amazon Review Sentiment Analyzer

This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model using Amazon product reviews. Leveraging VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), the model aims to classify reviews into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Analyze the sentiment of Amazon product reviews using pre-trained sentiment analysis tools.
- Understand customer behavior through textual data.
- Build a clean, user-friendly application using Streamlit (in future iterations).
- Implement live review analysis functionality (planned).
